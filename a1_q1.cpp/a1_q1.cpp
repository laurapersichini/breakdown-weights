 Project: Breaking down weights (question #1)
 Purpose: Find the number of weights required for each weight type given an intitial weight.
 Due date: September 25th, 2020
 */

/*
 To test the program logic, I used values of 100, 500, and then 2048.
 I did so to verify that the program was outputting the correct number of each of the
 weight types. Since the weight given input must be an integer, this means the input number can
 range from -2147483648 to 21474783647 (range of values for an integer in C++). However, only
 positive integers should be inputted because negative weights do not make sense.
 For step (1) of the assignment, I recorded an output of- 125 weights: 16, 75 weights:0,
 42 weights:1, 15 weights:0, 1 weights: 6.
